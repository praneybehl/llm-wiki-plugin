# Wiki Schema

This file is the configuration for this wiki. It documents the conventions, page types, tag taxonomy, and any workflow customizations. The LLM reads this first when entering the wiki, and its conventions override the defaults documented in the `llm-wiki` skill.

This file is **co-evolved with the user**. When the LLM notices a recurring pattern in your edits or feedback that isn't here, it will propose adding it. When something here stops fitting, prune it.

## Wiki location

- Wiki root: `wiki/`
- Raw sources: `raw/`
- Asset/image storage: `raw/assets/`

## Page types

This wiki uses these page types, each with a dedicated subdirectory:

- `source` (in `wiki/sources/`) — one summary page per ingested source.
- `entity` (in `wiki/entities/`) — pages about specific things: people, papers, products, places, organizations.
- `concept` (in `wiki/concepts/`) — pages about ideas, methods, frameworks, abstractions.
- `synthesis` (in `wiki/synthesis/`) — cross-cutting analyses, comparisons, query answers filed back.

Add additional types here as the wiki evolves.

## Tag taxonomy

(Empty initially. Add tags here as you adopt them, with one-line descriptions. Keep this list small and disciplined — a wiki with 200 tags has effectively no tags.)

Example structure:
- `methodology` — pages about research or analytical methods.
- `open-question` — pages or sections that flag unresolved questions.
- `contested` — pages where sources contradict.

## Page sizing

- Soft cap: 400 lines / ~2,000 words. Consider splitting beyond this.
- Hard cap: 800 lines. Must split.

## Frontmatter requirements

Every page must have:
- `type`
- `title`
- `tags`
- `created`
- `updated`

Plus type-specific:
- `source` pages: `authors`, `url` (if applicable), `raw`, `ingested`
- Non-source pages: `sources` listing the source-summary pages drawn from

## Index structure

(Update this section when sharding.)

Currently flat: a single `wiki/index.md` listing all pages.

When the wiki passes ~150 pages or `index.md` exceeds 300 lines, shard into `wiki/indexes/<type>.md` and update this section.

## Workflow customizations

(Empty initially. Document any deviations from the default ingest/query/lint workflows here.)

## User preferences

(Empty initially. As the user expresses style preferences — "always include a 'Why this matters' section on concept pages", "never use bullet lists in summaries", "prefer comparative tables for synthesis pages" — capture them here so they persist across sessions.)

## Lint cadence

- Structural lint: after every 5 ingests.
- Semantic lint: weekly or after every 20 ingests.
- Gap-finding: monthly.

Adjust based on the wiki's growth rate.
